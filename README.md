# Weather-Script-Using-Simple-API
This is my first experimental Program with Api, I used OpenWeatherMap
Day 1 : Just Recorded how URL responded to my API url
Day 2 : Today i made few changes, JSON Helped me to extract data from the website (api call), And i print few parameters of the weather based on the search!
Day 3 : Really Awsome.
